This is the main directory for the 2D Hubbard benchmark data.

look at ../Benchmarks.pdf for a description of the physics

The data is in three main directories:

t1_tprime0.2 for t=1, t'=0.2
t1_tprime-0.2 for t=1, t'=-0.2
t1_tprime0 for t=1, t'=0

these directories contain folders with the name

tL_tprimeM_UN_nO_TP

with 
L the hopping parameter t
M the next-nearest hopping parameter t'
N the interaction strength U
O the density n
P the temperature T
...as described in ../Benchmarks.pdf


Inside these directories are data from different methods, named after the observable and technique

E_technique.dat
D_technique.dat
M_techniqe.dat
Delta_technique.dat

where technique describes the technique used to generate the data. For example:

technique=DMET: Density Matrix Embedding Theory data
technique=DCA: Dynamical Cluster Approximation data
technique=NLCE: Numerical linked cluster data

All data is given as:
n \Delta n O \delta O

where n is the density, \Delta n the error on the density (zero for canonical methods, but non-zero for grand-canonical methods), O is the value of an observable, and \delta O is the error on O.


generate_directories.py generates all directories of the benchmark plots with the right file name
